title: Bootstrap your github pages.
---

A Simple recepie to host your blog for free. I am hoping that this will bring blogging in my workflow and i can blog from my favorite text editor.

As everything else in software there are options coming up in this space (Jekyll, Octopress, Middleman) but i will stick to the simplest one (as that is the whole idea of using github pages).

You can follow the steps below for setting up a site.

* Clone git clone git@github.com:poole/poole.git and copy to your own github_acc_name.github.io repo.
* git clone git@github.com:poole/lanyon.git 
* Do a cp -r on all directories from lanyon to your github.io repo.
* Install Jekyll
* Run jekyll serve &amp; browse http://127.0.0.1:4000
